How maintainable are your RPG applications? How do you measure the progress of a refactoring project? There are many metrics (some of them standard metrics and other ad hoc) that can answer those questions. For the RPG world there aren't many tools that can help you calculate those metrics. _Code Metrics_ is an open source tool written completely in RPG that calculates Maintainability metrics for RPG. 

_Code metrics_ calculates:
 * Deprecated operators
 * Lines per Spec
 * Blank lines
 * Comment lines
 * Fixed-Form lines
 * Free-Form lines
 * In-line variable declarations
 * Free-compatible operators
